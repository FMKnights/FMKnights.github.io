            I am studying Computer Science and right now working as an IT. My future goals in my life are to make my own business.
                To try to find something or do something out of the box and figure out how to stand out. Its really hard to think out side the box.
                But honestly once you do or figure out something then you are set. Like that the great example of Steve Jobs creating a Ipod that can stored 1000 of songs.
                I want to do something like that in my life so lets see if I can.<br>

            <p>On the other side right now I have my own photography business and its running good. But its not something that I can say Yes I did it.
                Its a small business that I started and it bring some good money every month.
